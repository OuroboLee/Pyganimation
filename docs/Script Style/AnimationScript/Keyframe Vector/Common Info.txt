Keyframe vector animation style:

Rest frames and Last-frame must have KEYFRAME_NORMAL_INFO for each key 
which KEYFRAME_INTERPOLATE_INFO has.

[1] 

Values in KEYFRAME_NORMAL_INFO in rest frames are the corresponding frame interpolation value
between the last value and the first value in subsequent keyframes 
if the corresponding key is not given.
